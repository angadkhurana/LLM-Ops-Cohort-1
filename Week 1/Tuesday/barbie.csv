","As a woman that grew up with Barbie, I was very excited for this movie. I was curious to see how they would evolve the ""stereotypical Barbie"" into something more. But the messaging in this movie was so heavy handed that it completely lost the plot. I consider myself a proponent of gender equality, and this ain't the way to get it.",/review/rw9319915/?ref_=tt_urv
1,21 July 2023,LoveofLegacy,6," Beautiful film, but so preachy
","Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the ""strong"" woman.",/review/rw9319915/?ref_=tt_urv

","As much as it pains me to give a movie called ""Barbie"" a 10 out of 10, I have to do so. It is so brilliantly handled and finely crafted, I have to give the filmakers credit. Yes, I am somewhat conservative person and former law enforcement officer. I'm a guy. I like guy things. Hell I even enjoyed the Battleship movie a few years ago (an absolutely ridiculous but fun romp of an action film). But I also like to experience other perspectives. And man oh man does this movie deliver that in spades - pretty much encapsulated everything my wife has tried to convey about her entire career and life experience wrapped up into two hours! The humor, the sets, the acting, and the ability to weave the current narrative into the story was just perfect. I don't agree with some of the points of the movie, but again, that's ok. This movie wasn't designed to give a balanced perspective of men versus women; it is a no-holds-barred unapologetic crazy ride of a rant about the real issues that women have faced since they were ""allowed"" to have ""real jobs"" and do the same things as men. Give me a well done film that is a blast to watch, that makes you think, and that was done from a place of creativity, passion, and attention to detail, and I'll call it what it is: a 10 out of 10 masterpiece.",/review/rw9319915/?ref_=tt_urv

But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect.

While i'm not so sure at first, the movie kept getting even more fun, entertaining, and definitely better, also surprisingly deal with a legit serious stuff, Barbie is a weirdly fun movie that fills with this very interesting concept, definitely the first time that's ever done, Greta Gerwig has created this whole new style of filmmaking specifically for Barbie, from the intentionally weird yet creative editing, some awkward and cringe scene, i found the comedy so funny instead of cringe, Barbie is one of the most original movie of the year and also one of the most original movie i've seen in a while, we all know Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is gonna carry the movie and they are, but Will Ferrell, Simu Liu, and the whole rest of the cast were also great and entertaining, the soundtrack was just great, except Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice ""Barbie World"" song that are just absolutely terrible, but Billie Eilish ""What Was I Made For?"" tune that kept haunting in the background until it finally get the perfect scene to played it was really the best thing because that song was just beautiful and emotional, anyway, Barbie is a lot of fun, while there is still some noticeable flawed, most of them i found it funny, entertaining, colourful, creative, and fun, pure fun, it's something that i probably will love it even more the second time i see it, but as of right now, Barbie was a good time, definitely recommended and with this movie somehow it's actually possible to have a live-action Barbie movie, all you need to have is a good writer, good director, and good cast, and they delivers mostly.",/review/rw9319915/?ref_=tt_urv

The movie was hilarious that I remember my mouth was opened laughing the whole time you know, all the Barbie jokes. And it's so cute that just right at the beginning of the movie, I instantly fell back to my childhood memories and everything is pink it's so beautiful.

She believes that the real world must be just like hers, where women are recognized for their achievements and always given the opportunity, respect, and tools to succeed in life.

It was really silly because there was no accurate reflection of America at any single point except for Barbie getting called a Fascist for no reason by a 14 year old. I enjoyed how they called out women for hating women and how they really tried to preach empowerment and the ability to be anything, but at the same time there was so much resentment and they ended the movie by reinstating hate. The majority of the movie was hating men as much as possible. That's just whatever because what really matters is the story. Well it fell short on that mark and it was really disappointing.

","Let me start by saying that I'm by no means a conservative or traditional woman. I believe that inequality for women still is rampant even in first world countries and that we go through many problems. But damn...this movie is so corporate and shallow. It's clearly ordered and tailored by executives at Mattel to rebrand and sell more dolls. The movie starts well and has the potential of becoming something very good, but then it just goes downhill: the premise of the owner's feeling being projected onto the doll was going to lead to a very nice build up about a person's life journey and then Barbie and Ken go to the human world and cue in the speeches and preaching. This movie suffers from a bad case of showing and not telling, they keep repeating the same dialogues: patriarchy bad patriarchy bad patriarchy bad sexism sexism sexism, not even one time but MULTIPLE TIMES. These characters go into random rants like its a ted talk! The chemistry between the mother and daughter is absolutely nonexistent and their relationship is so cringe, You cant root for them or feel their feelings at all. Barbie should have understood how Kens had been feeling in the Barbieland the whole time which is a mimic of how many women are still treated in the society: just existing for the gaze of a woman (man). Yet what do they do? They manipulate them (with a super nonsense plan) and force them back to their original position while she gives him a half assed apology that could have been done better and end up to a more accurate point about equality. (I guess this is again meta and a reflection of how women are pitted against each other while people in charge benefit from that but its so badly done that it feels meh.)
I can imagine that in the boardroom they went through a discussion like this: People are going to think this is a feel good movie so we need to give them something deeper but also lets make it absurd and fast paced so that we can finish the plot quickly and also jump on the ""not taking itself serious"" bandwagon and also market these dolls again in the age of smartphone kids. The only reason this movie gets at 5 from me is the humor, which sometimes becomes very meta and creative and Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling have acted very well. Besides this, they could have just given us a simple feel good movie and I would have respected the creators more. Pass.",/review/rw9319915/?ref_=tt_urv

It has a wonderful creative voice and a beautiful mix of comedy and respectfully addresses hard topics in a way that I think everyone can benefit from. I can understand how some people find it preachy but I disagree because this is a love letter to women. There are so many things that stuck with me and I will probably remember forever. I am impressed with the amount or detail, creativity, and love that was so obviously put into this movie. Greta Gerwig and the rest of the production team did a beautiful job creating an immersive thought provoking experience that brought me to tears. This is by far Margot and Ryan's best performance I've seen and they deserve all the love for it. The sci-fi references are also a very interesting touch that I didn't expect.

Instead, it felt more like an agent of woke culture, and basically Mattel's (the company that produces Barbie dolls) way of capitalizing the emotional aspect of the cinephiles to make their business more popular and trendier. It continuously tried to portray the fact that Mattel is no more producing white barbie dolls, it is now producing dolls of all colors and races. Well, that is definitely a good thing, but making most of the movie focus on that aspect felt very boring and wrong. If they didn't quite make a movie that is fun and adventurous, why make the marketing events misleading? They could've just focused on the audience for whom it was made, rather than on the entire world through their absurdly irrelevant marketing events that made the world think that this movie is going to be all about fun and adventure.

The screenplay is the weakest part. The direction is next weakest. And those two caused a great cast to overact. When this movie takes itself seriously it gets tedious. It's preachy. We are constantly being told what we are seeing and what we should think about what we are thinking. This is not engaging. Why can't we think for ourselves based on what we see? I hated being treated like a ten year old and being spoonfed the morals, thoughts and feelings. But then maybe the target audience is ten-year-olds. In any event, I thought it would never end.

They wanted Ken to take the patriarchy back to Barbieland but this happens immediately and off screen despite the Kens being bumbling morons the entire movie. It's all payoff and no buildup.

","Im not really disappointed or love the movie to be honest. It was kind of weird and strange at the beginning: we understand it later because we are in the Barbie world. So they played with the culture reference of the barbie, the dolls and what they represent: an ideal world with where the womans are in power. Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial. But i enjoyed that Barbie realised the problems of our world and compare to her own. Some moments was funny and some more serious or drama sometimes even if its pretty soft because we are in Barbie Land. I mean i spend a great time but it was kind of ok. And i still think its a great Barbie movie: the task was not easy to represent that world but i enjoyed the set design, the colors, the camera movements. I think people who played with Barbie dolls or just know the universe will be happy; they have a lot of references to the world and a lot of Barbie references to the dolls and the differents clothes and the impact of her in society.

Gerwig's direction is solid, but the most impressive thing about this film is its sensational production design which is amazing, some cute musical numbers with Barbie and Ken, and the superb cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto. The supporting performances are all good, but why America Ferrera got an Oscar nomination for her okay performance is beyond me, however special kudos must go to Rhea Perlman who delivers an wonderfully endearing performance in an extended cameo.

And for that part it was totally ok. But the movie absolutely doesn't deserve an imdb rating above 5.6. The plot itself was very simple. Absolutely nothing particularly special in it.

However, this is the era of comic book movies targeting ""grown-ups"", and since we know, based on her previous work (the exceptional LADY BIRD, 2017), Greta Gerwig is an intelligent filmmaker, a more reasonable assumption is that she purposefully aimed the movie at women who once played with Barbie dolls and now fill their days with work, family, and adulting.

","Barbie was a very fun, light-hearted, over-the-top movie that takes you on a wild journey. The fact that it paid homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey's opening sequence earned it extra points for me! Ryan Gosling was great and Margot Robbie was perfectly cast, and the production design was fantastic. A comedy movie should mainly be judged on its comedy, and Barbie for the most part is actually quite funny! I also loved how the narrator speaks over the movie at certain points and delivers some funny lines. This may get some backlash, but I feel Barbie is a movie that earns popularity because it propagates feminist ideals and speaks to the issues women face today, and audiences are willing to look past its flaws to celebrate the movie because the message it portrays is very relevant in society today. I feel the same way with Sound of Freedom. Just because a movie talks about issues you care about, however important they may be, doesn't mean it's the ""greatest movie of all time"" and ""Oscar-worthy"" etc. The plot of Barbie seemed quite interesting to me, how Barbie goes into the real world and the chaos that could cause. But I feel like the movie got TOO drenched in the social commentary and thus didn't give the creative plot idea enough justice. Movies don't have to be so explicit with the social commentary, as shown by movies like 12 Angry Men (1957), which IMO does a far better job at tackling racism and prejudice than any film made today. At certain times, Barbie really blurred the line between being anti-patriarchy and being anti-men.

It's charming, funny, touching, powerful and overall perfect. The soundtrack is fantastic, I've been listening to I'm Just Ken on repeat for days now.

151,6 January 2024,svynronin,6," A Tale of Two Halves
","The movie starts in one direction and then changes course half way through to a rushed and unsatisfying end. The second hour of the movie is a stark contrast to the first hour. There were funny moments mixed with thoughtful gender roles, views on our patriarchal society, self-worth, etc. That took a complicated subject and made it interesting in the first half. The problem is, the movie then begins to take itself too seriously and the second half loses the clever comedy and pushes stereotypes of male and female gender roles in our society to become a rushed mess of a story that becomes preachy. There are a lot of issues in today's society with regards to gender roles, feminism, our patriarchal society, etc. The problem is the movie seems to take on some of these issues with comedy, then takes a more serious tone, and rushes through the second half so that characters brought forward in the first half have no real resolution. Sure Barbie finds her purpose at the movie's end, but it becomes a mess to get there. The rich comedy common in the first half turns to slapstick and serious drama. Are there two more opposites than slapstick and drama? The first half had me rethinking my views on how women are treated with it's lighthearted comedy, while the second half had me bothered by pushing male stereotypes into a slapstick war and a rush to finish while also being preached to about male and female gender roles. The movie seems to lose it's purpose and then rushes for a resolution. The mom and daughter story would have been better explored with a light hearted comedy that touches on gender roles and a woman's self-worth, and making it for the whole family but especially focused on an audience of young girls and women who are trying to figure out who they are. It really should have explored the mother and daughter characters and how they each struggle with being a woman in society and used Barbie as a tool of them helping to better understand each other. The movie glosses over this and despite their differences their complicated relationship is easily fixed as the focus turns back to Barbie and the focus on her. The movie brings up good ideas and a good story to once again have Hollywood ruin it. It loses focus as too many ideas, issues, characters, and plots, are brought up, to have it rushed to a finish with only some resolved. All a common problem with too many Hollywood movies these days. What is the purpose of your story? Who is it written for? Why are you writing it? Focus on that, and don't let others over complicate it. It's sad that a movie that brings up important issues especially with women's self-worth with both older and younger women is ruined by too much of everything else this movie takes on.",/review/rw9319915/?ref_=tt_urv

","Barbie was a very funny and cute movie, however, the movie had more fluff than substance. The plot of this movie to me seems like it was created by writing ""lego movie"" and ""barbie goes to the real world"" on a piece of paper and then just winging it from there. The movie did not flow very well and the plot line seemed almost secondary to the message that the movie was trying to preach. I say preach because the movie never actually showed any conflicts for women except for maybe one or two quick shots. Instead we got a monologue from America Ferrera's character telling us the problems but never showing us any. For this reason I feel it was hard to build a connection with Barbie especially in the final act when the movie took a turn to try and be more deep than funny goofy like it had been the whole movie. There was also not very good resolution for a lot of characters. The Kens never truly got a resolution, like the writers couldn't come up with a good solution. Will Farrels character seemed almost forgotten about by the half way mark of the movie. Overall it was a very funny movie, but not a very solid one. The message felt like it was preached rather than shown, the ending felt forced down the throat rather than conclusive.

There were some good comic scenes, and stand-out performances by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, but as the film wore on, it all became a bit preachy. The message seemed to be about finding self-fulfilment rather than romance. Okay, not every film, or every life, has to end in a fairy-tale romantic coupling, but the emphasis on individual fulfilment within the support structure of the sisterhood seems a little bleak.

","This movie was so perfect especially as someone who has grown up with Barbie and was in pure awe of her from birth to the age of 12. I was forced to grow up due to peer pressure when I hit twelve so bye bye Barbie. I always regretted doing that because I wasn't ready to say goodbye but everyone else my age was. It breaks my soul seeing young girls, younger than I was letting go of their childhood so quick, trying to keep up with the older teen trends. It breaks my soul because if I was one of those girls I would be crying for my Barbie while conforming to society. Gloria's speech absolutely rocked my world. I need that tattooed in my brain, Greta is an absolute inspiration to women and girls everywhere. One thing about Barbie is I would not have an education without her. When I started school I refused to do my work unless I was promised a Barbie when I returned home, and it worked. If Barbie had not inspired women so long ago, I would probably not have completed my education as I would have found there to be no point. One thing is that I am sad or is a Barbie movie for one reason only, men will not likely see this. My brother and dad had no interest in even looking at promotion or trailers, there is no way I can get them to see this masterpiece, and they NEED to see this it is so important. If there is one movie that can change the course of history it is this one, as the introduction of Barbie did. I'm so proud and excited for Greta Gerwig and what is to come. As a newly out of school 18 year old my passion is to become a director or an actress, and Greta's work delights me everyday because of Greta, I have a chance. Before Greta's movie, I actually never heard of a female director in film, so it never even came into my head as a possibility before Greta came in. This movie has come at a perfect time for me as I turned 18 last month so this is my kickstart to womanhood, and what a way to start. I ask every woman and girl to watch this and I ask them to drag whichever man in their lives that they can. This movie is the epitome of ""yes"" there are no other words to perfectly signify this. Now, after all the mushy stuff, the humour in this film was perfect, there was never a cringy joke moment unless it was intended that way, and they never put a joke in a bad place. I was slightly worried the album may overshadow the movie, but it was perfect, never took anything away from the movie. Ryan Gosling did a fantastic job because I really believed he was Ken, nothing in me could say ""yeah that's Ryan"".

","I have seen this film in theaters twice now and I can safely say that I thought it was amusing, entertaining, and fun. However, I won't lie to you and say that it's really all that groundbreaking as some seem to claim. While this movie focuses on heavy topics such as inequality and feminism, some of the scenes that had primarily concentrated on them had felt a little shallow. I am not saying that this wasn't a great film, as said before, it delivered most if not all of the checkpoints that modern day society defines a ""good movie"" with. Now I can't say that I wasn't entertained mostly through the movie but it just lacked something. The longer this film had stuck with me the longer it felt insufficient. People that are currently speaking on this movie seem to pin up its success in presenting femininity and women's issues in a lighthearted and joyful manner, however I feel that the overall message in this movie could have been provided in a more severe tone. The creators of Barbie stated that this was an ""everyone movie"", that this film was designed to cater to all viewers, but did it have to? The laughable tone this movie brought along with its own narrative of modern day feminism sort of cheapened the message. Don't get me wrong, all the acting in the movie was phenomenal for the roles each actor portrayed, but it felt like some of the plot had gotten lost in translation. Even after watching the movie twice I still am a little fuzzy on the entirety of ""Barbieland"". Where is this really set?, why it is a common occurrence of dolls making their way into the real world?, why do barbies know they're toys? I might just be inattentive but these plot point were rarely touched on through the film and still leave me confused. Overall I think my main issue with this film is my regrettable rating, I really didn't want this movie to be below a 9. I was really looking forward to this film and eagerly waiting to ""do anything to see it in theaters again"", but it turned out to be just ok.

","The big summer blockbuster of 2023 is a wonderful visual spectacle with a great deal of creative physical comedy, centered in and around the universe of Barbie, Mattel's historic toy doll. Unfortunately, the film tries to be and do much more than what the filmmakers ultimately are able to control and reel in. That a movie about Barbie would be guilty of Americanization is no surprise, and in many ways more than befitting, but the Americanization here isn't just about the history of the toy itself and all its cultural impacts - Barbie also views everything through the eyes of Hollywood anno 2023 - which arguably is a very particular and perhaps not that representative outlook. Instead of utilizing the fine foundation laid in the film's first third, director and co-writer Greta Gervig (Lady Bird, Little Women) gets herself lost in a trite, divisive and most likely futile battle of the sexes, which will leave youths - and perhaps particularly Europeans - feeling confused and conflicted. The filmmakers' supposed toying with stereotypes ultimately becomes more of a playing into them, especially towards the end when Gerwig staggers along desperately looking for closure and something meaningful to say. Alas, Barbie has ended up as a rather sad symptom of our times, when it could have been the wonderfully funny piece of femininity-appraising escapism it started out as. There are nonetheless several highlights here, such as the delightfully absurd opening sequence (a fine nod to Kubrick's 2001), the initial introduction of Barbie and Ken's days in Barbieland, and - of course - their first encounter with the real world.",/review/rw9319915/?ref_=tt_urv

","Despite the strong commercial tone, it is still possible to perceive that we are watching a film by Greta Gerwig, director known for dramatic comedies that capture the complexity of femininity in an original way - although, in this case, it is almost inevitable to fall into some clichés. The undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director - in addition to Margot Robbie herself as a producer. ""Barbie"" has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today. And the film does it with a big heart: the story is genuinely fun, with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence, but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists, reserving touching moments and provoking reflections, especially in its final stretch. Debauchery is the great ally of Gerwig and Baumbach to deal not only with sexism, but also with the ""corporate"" issue.

","I didn't see Barbie in the theater (but I don't see many in the theater anymore) but I had seen glowing reviews as well as friends who had seen the film and recommended. By the time I was able to view the film I had high expectations. There were certainly extremely funny moments, but for me few and far between. Gosling was singled out by many as the best in the film and I agreed there were enough outlandish moments with his character that earned him that. But, I thought that Michael Cera's character Allan was far funnier, even though his role was more of an extended cameo. I can't deny that Margot Robbie was an exceptional Barbie but overall I was disappointed with the film. Gerwig went a bit too far with her support of women's rights (which I do support).

Instead, I was greeted with an overly dramatic, some would say cringey, movie that sounds badly written. It seems that this movie doesn't fit in any category. It is definitely not a drama, nor a comedy as all the jokes were laughable, but for the wrong reason.

Things will get pretty normal after they enter the real world and all the problems: sexual remark, womens and their place in society (the inequality with mens.) I was pretty sure they will talk about the problems with womans and their complex because of Barbie and the perfect women she is and how this is contrasted with the real world. Its pretty obvious that they will talk about it. I love also how Ken will also notice how mens are more powerful in the real world: its like everyone see that reality is not really what they perceived themselves in their own reality and power will shift also later in Barbie Land. I understand why they act like this and stuff but i didnt really get into the movie to be honest: i only identify myself when they talked about society and business but all the musical things, the choregraphy and even the morality was kind of superficial.

But also how hard it is to be a woman. And not just that. Also our childhood. The barbieland is our childhood. Peaceful, enjoying life. But when it's our time to leave it, it's scary and new because that's the adult life. The finale scene shows us that to live is the most beautiful thing we can experience. And some people are stereotypical barbies who don't know how to live their life in the most human way. We are here to smile, cry and improve ourselves. But sometimes we get lost and need to find ourselves again. It's a cycle that we need to go through. This movie represents a lot of things not just one. And I think everyone who watches that film can find a different meaning.",/review/rw9319915/?ref_=tt_urv

I don't think is ""too preachy"" as other comments say. Is an important message that needs to be tackled more to have a more fair society maybe one day. Even ignoring the message, it had a good comedic approach to not just be depressed by the reality it shows, had great music, good acting, creativity, good visuals, all in all great movie.

249,1 August 2023,jboothmillard,7," Barbie
","The first Barbie fashion doll was released by Mattel in 1954, there have been several straight-to-DVD computer-animated cartoons, but it has taken 64 for a live-action movie to be made. This was one of the most hyped-up movies of the year, I certainly couldn't ignore it, directed by Golden Globe nominated Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird, Little Women). Basically, the film opens with the Narrator (Dame Helen Mirren) explaining the history of dolls before the introduction of Barbie (a parody of 2001: A Space Odyssey) and how Barbie came to change the world. Barbieland is a matriarchal society where all ranges of living Barbie and Ken dolls reside. All the women are self-confident, self-sufficient, and successful, while the men spend their days engaging in recreational activities at the beach. All Barbies hold all important job positions such as doctors, lawyers, journalists, pilots, astronauts, and politicians. ""Stereotypical"" Barbie (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Margot Robbie) lives her best life all day every day, while her on-off boyfriend Ken (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Ryan Gosling) is only happy when he is with her, and she shows him some attention. Ken seeks a closer relationship, but Barbie rebuffs him to be independent and continue her female friendships. Barbie holds one of her regular parties at her Dreamhouse, which momentarily halts when she asks a question about mortality. The following day, Barbie finds her regular routine has altered, her raised feet have gone flat and she has cellulite. Her friends, including Writer Barbie (Alexandra Shipp), Physicist Barbie (Emma Mackey) and Lawyer Barbie (Sharon Rooney) tell her to visit Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a wise but disfigured outcast who was played with badly, giving her permanent splits and felt-tip pen drawn on her face. Weird Barbie tells her to cure her affliction, she must go to the real world and find the child playing with her. Weird Barbie does offer her the option to take her heal shoe and everything will return to normal but really wants her to take the second option (a parody of The Matrix). Driving her pink convertible outside of Barbieland, Barbie finds Ken stowed away, he insists he is coming with her, and she reluctantly agrees. Barbie and Ken travel by car, by boat, by rocket, by bicycle, by campervan, and by snowmobile (all deliberate cut-out scenarios), until they arrive at Venice Beach, Los Angeles, California. The two cause a stir while exploring, including with their colourful roller-skating gear and blades, then changing into cowboy outfits. At toy manufacturer Mattel, the creators of Barbie, the all-male board members are informed that Barbie has entered the real world. The CEO (Will Ferrell) orders her to be captured and brought to them to be put back in her box. At the local school, Barbie encounters a tween girl named Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt) who criticises Barbie dolls for encouraging unrealistic beauty standards and attitudes about women. Meanwhile, Ken explores the city and learns about the patriarchal system, mistakenly believing it was all started by men and horses. It is through simple interactions with people that he feels respected and accepted for the first time; with everything he has learned he returns to Barbieland. Feeling distraught by Sasha's comments, Barbie soon meets Sasha's mother Gloria (Oscar nominated America Ferrera), a Mattel employee, who is the person who was playing with her. Gloria is the catalyst of her existential crisis; she was playing with Sasha's old Barbie toys while experiencing her own identity crisis, inadvertently transferring her concerns to Barbie. Soon, Mattel agents arrive and take Barbie to headquarters. They attempt to put Barbie in a toy box for remanufacturing, but she escapes with Gloria and Sasha's help. During the pursuit, Barbie enters a room containing a 1950s home scenario and encounters an elderly lady (Rhea Perlman) who recognises her. Returning to Barbieland, they discover that it has changed dramatically. The Kens have taken over, while Barbies have been reduced to submissive roles, such as maids, housewives, and agreeable girlfriends. Barbie tries to convince Ken and the Barbies to return to the way things were, only to be rebuffed. Barbie becomes depressed and returns to Weird Barbie and her group of discontinued dolls. Gloria gives an inspirational speech about society's conflicting expectations of women, and Barbie's self-confidence is restored. Meanwhile, the CEO and board members are making their way to Barbieland. With the assistance of Sasha, Weird Barbie, Ken's friend Allan (Michael Cera), a lone and discontinued character, and other discontinued dolls, Gloria repeats her moving words to all Barbies to snap them out of their subordinate behaviours. Ken intends to cement the changes to Barbieland and create male superiority by changing the constitution, allowing men to become President and replace all other roles taken by the women. The restored Barbies manipulate the Kens to fight against each other to distract them from the alterations. The Barbies regain their positions of power but also realise the errors of Barbieland's previous societal system. They decide to make changes, including better treatment for the Kens and all outcast dolls. Barbie and Ken apologise to each other and acknowledge their failings. Ken feels that he has no identity or purpose without Barbie, she encourages him to find himself. Barbie remains unsure of her own purpose and identity. She suddenly finds herself in a heavenly place where she encounters the elderly lady again, revealing herself to be the spirit of Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler. Ruth explains that she created Barbie as a toy that represented what girls ""wanted to be""; she named ""Barbie"" after her daughter Barbara. After a montage of home footage of young girls playing, Ruth explains that Barbie's story has no set ending. After the Barbies, Kens, and Mattel executives bid Barbie goodbye, she decides to become human and return to the real world. Sometime later, Gloria, her husband (Ryan Piers Williams), and Sasha take Barbie, now going by the name ""Barbara Handler"", to a building for an appointment, and she enters asking to see her gynaecologist. Also starring Issa Rae as President Barbie, Hari Nef as Dr. Barbie, Shang-Chi's Simu Liu as Tourist Ken, Kingsley Ben-Adir as Basketball Ken, Sex Education's Ncuti Gatwa as Artist Ken, Jamie Demetriou as Mattel CFO, Scott Evans as Stereotypical Ken, Ana Cruz Kayne as Judge Barbie, Ritu Arya as Journalist Barbie, Derry Girls' Nicola Coughlan as Diplomat Barbie, Dua Lipa as the Mermaid Barbies, John Cena as Ken Merman, Asim Chaudhry as Warehouse Employee, Ray Fearon as Dan at the FBI, Erica Ford as Skipper, Emerald Fennell as Midge, Lucy Boynton as Proust Barbie, Rob Brydon as Sugar Daddy Ken, and costume designer Ann Roth as the Woman on the Bench. Robbie (who was snubbed an OScar nomination!) is gorgeous and perfectly cast as the loveable ""stereotypical"" Barbie going on an adventure, Gosling as the muscly, foolish, attention-seeking Ken is splendid, McKinnon is hilarious as the mangled Weird Barbie, Ferrera is good support, Ferrell is amusing, many other supporting cast members and the cameo performers are terrific, and the voice of Mirren (occasionally breaking the fourth wall) is great. Gerwig (who snubbed a direction Oscar nomination!) and her co-writer/real-life partner Noah Baumbach (Frances Ha, Marriage Story) were given full creative freedom for the script. They are unafraid to poke fun at the Barbie world, including many references to discontinued lines and how kids play with the toys, and interesting ideas of feminism, body image, female empowerment, the battle of the sexes, and the human experience. The visuals are sugar-coated and saturated with colour, pink obviously most prominent, with impressive set and costume design, and the soundtrack of catchy pop songs (""Pink"" by Lizzo, ""Dance the Night"" by Dua Lipa) (the original ""Barbie Girl"" by Aqua does not feature?!, there is the new version by Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice with Aqua) and fun song and dance routines. It could have been a conventional girly Barbie film with a dull love story or something and a happy ending, but it goes the other direction and benefits completely with its deliberately surreal and cheesy approach, a bonkers but inventive and worthwhile fantasy comedy. It won the Oscar for Best Original Song for ""What Was I Made For?"" for Billie Eilish and Finneas O'Connell (also won the Golden Globe), and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Original Song for ""I'm Just Ken"" for Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt (also nominated the Golden Globe), Best Adapted Screenplay for Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, Best Production Design, and Best Costume Design, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Original Screenplay, Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, and it won the Golden Globe for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement, and it was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, Best Screenplay, and Best Original Song for ""Dance the Night"" for Dua Lipa, Mark Ronson, Andrew Wyatt, and Caroline Ailin.

","Ever since I saw Lady Bird, I knew that I will love Greta and her style. It was so human and it spoke to me. So when Barbie was released, there was no doubt I will like this film-but not this much. In 114 minutes, Greta serves everything that she intended sending a beautiful positive message about womanhood. What it means to be human, what it means to live in this broken patriarchal system. The message is clear: to be human is to feel. This movie is funny. And as someone who is not a fan of American humor, that's a big one. But I laughed through the entire movie. I also shared a tear. I loved America's monologue about womanhood. I loved Dame Helen Mirren as a narrator-great choice. Margot is a star. Her Barbie is so authentic. She portrays comedy, as well as the emotional part of the character so well. That last scene was so good. Now I can't skip the star of the film, and that is Ryan Gossling. Ken was hilarious and I will quote him for the rest of my life. But also shows that Greta is sweet to men offering them compassion by showing them that they are enough as it is, they don't have to be more than that. Greta (and Noah), really made a beautiful love letter to womanhood by showing all the parts of it-please the scene with the old lady had my heart.

","I loved the first part of this movie. There is a a lot of excitement, wonder, meaning and humor. The main actors are very good and it all seems to be going so well. Barbie is looking for the girl who owned her in the real world. Ken hides in the back seat and comes along. At a certain point the movie becomes a story about the patriarchy suppressing women. There are some long speeches that really do not have a lot of emotional impact. At the start of the movie Ken is a puppet in Barbie world where Barbie controls everything, then it seems like they try to make the point that men and women don't need eachother and I don't think that is right. I think the movie should have been more fair to how men and women can be a great team in stead of being individuals and at odds. All in all I liked the movie, but it could have been better. If I'm saying that because I am a man and just don't get the plights of womanhood, then I'm sorry, but my experience in my own life is that it's not easy to be a man in this world of hours, I don't believe it's the case that men have all the advantages. Ken constantly confess his love to Barbie, but the movie says that his love is not real because he doesn't own Barbie. This to me does not represent men well. When I look around in the society I live in, I don't see men who own their women. I see men and women who love eachother and want to live together and I don't see what's wrong with that.

","This movie falls apart with any sort of critical evaluation. There are good and funny moments of the film, but I don't think the film is going to hold up in the coming years. It claims to be an examination of feminism through the eyes of this doll. The dolls think that they have solved the problems of the real world by their existence, a trip to the real world makes it clear that this is not the case. The Kens, who are an underclass in the fantasy world, stage a rebellion and take it over. The rebellion is put down and everything returns to the status quo. And the status quo is not gender equality, it's a ruling class and a subservient class. Stripping the ideology away from the film, the story of how this universe works doesn't make any sense. The dolls are the way they are because of the way that children are playing with them. So if there is sort of a matriarchal Utopia, it's because little girls and little boys who are playing with the dolls have created it. So the ending of the film doesn't make any sense because the Barbies say that they don't want to return to the status quo and the Kens are learning about the real me. But they're not real. They're dolls, and their realities are determined for them. That's not the only weird part about the movie, there's the scene where the creator of the Barbie holds hands with Barbie and shows her all the feelings of a woman so that she can decide if she wants to be real or not. But in that montage, are no scenes of pain and suffering. So this Barbie becomes a real person and is set up for a life of horrible suffering because she does not understand the reality of pain. She hasn't even had a stomach ache before, or even digested food before, and now she's going to be a real woman? I don't mind films having ideologies, but I think the way filmmaking is going is not a direction in which I can follow. Apart from superhero movies, which people finally seem to be tired of, modern movie making is more about the feeling of a story, than the story. And I think there are a lot of problems with traditional storytelling and films, like the fact there are never unhappy endings in Hollywood blockbusters. But the structure of storytelling is one which gives satisfaction to the viewer because they can feel the process of the story coming together, and if there's no actual story where is the satisfaction for the viewer?",/review/rw9319915/?ref_=tt_urv

","This review will sorta just be a barebones review. There's no spoilers because this movie doesn't really have a plot or resolution that can be spoiled. The movie starts out with a reference from 2001: a space odyssey, Which im sure went right over the target audiences heads. Then breaks into a lot of corny jokes in Barbieland. Barbieland is the best part of the movie, the Barbies performances are all hammed up, kind of like a long progressive commercial. But the acting is supposed to be corny and overacted because they're barbies so I'll accept it. Barbieland has a lot of fun moments with the songs and dances and the beach and Cena. The design of Barbieland and costumes of the Barbies and Kens is why this movie is getting this hype ans it definitely lives up to it. Margot Robbie does a good job as barbie and Gosling as Ken is by far the funniest/best part of the movie. Barbie starts her crisis and goes to the real world and everything starts to suck. Ken finding out about patriarchy is the best thing about the real w orld. The jokes in this movie were really weak, the sentimental serious parts are really boring, this movie feels like it's 2 and 1/2 hours and it's only 1h45. Will Ferrell shows up but they forgot to write jokes for him. America Ferrera gives the most genuine performance but her character is devoid of logic and ends up just giving a long lecture. Lots of the corny jokes in this movie fall completely flat, but theres so many jokes in this movie that you will laugh at least a little bit. Men are targeted in this movie and it has no idea what subtlety is, but it is a Barbie movie so i can accept that. And most importantly this movie has no conflict resolution at all, they sorta just end the movie on one last moderately silly joke. This movie was sort of just a forgettable comedy with a lot of hype before it.

This movie isn't just aimed at kids in fact I would say it was definitely more for adults funny enough.

I know I'm late but I saw Barbie on OTT last night and believe you me, it was a torture! I mean, I sat through everything that Greta tried to sell but I just couldn't buy the entire thing. There are a couple of things which didn't make sense to me. I mean, the whole time, the movie was trying to make a point that patriarchy isn't good and it'll destroy all good things. At one point, Ryan Gosling's Ken is shown venting out his inner thoughts how he has always been kept in the shadows and taken for granted. I understand that Margot Robbie's Barbie didn't feel for him the same way, but then why enjoy the privileges and the attention? Also, when I finally saw her apologizing for her behavior, I thought that the story is going towards making a point that's equal. I thought equality is the end of the movie. But alas, it restored matriarchy in ""Barbieland"". I mean, how is common sense not so common these days? If you put moore weight on any one side of the weighing scale, YOU WILL LOSE BALANCE! It doesn't matter whether it's patriarchy or matriarchy! Towards the climax, the Barbies plan to turn the Kens onto each other in order to take back the power and governance of ""Barbieland"". And they do this by the means of MANIPULATION! So even if they're dolls and not real women, the only convenient way to get the job is manipulation! I know that someone can argue that the Kens deserved it because they did the same thing to the Barbies when they took over ""Barbieland"". And you're right only if you agree that neither Barbie nor Ken is perfect. If that was Ken's way, it was Barbie's too. One more scene that set me off was how, in the end, the Kens ask the president Barbie for a chair at the constituency and she says no. Before she said no, in my mind, I thought, ""Yes! This is the moment the Barbies show they're empathetic and different. The message of this movie would be equality!"" I was a fool to expect this from a movie that promoted matriarchy. Ken is brainwashed into thinking that he is ""Kenough"" and can has to find his own identity. While the Barbies will once again rule ""Barbieland"". I know there won't ever exist equality in this world. But I also know that there won't exist a ""Barbieland"" in reality too.

372,8 January 2024,ben-snooker,6," I didn't laugh once
","I had trouble following this story. I got the general idea but the dialog seemed to be all over the place. In a nutshell the story is as follows. Barbie senses someone is feeling bad in the real world then leaves Barbieland to try to make the person feel better about themselves. Meanwhile Ken discovers that men have more power in the real world than in Barbieland so when he goes back he rallies the other Ken dolls to take power by force. Meanwhile the Barbie's decide to stand up for themselves and take Barbieland back. Somehow there's some middle ground resolution which didn't seem to make sense. The end. I didn't laugh once so I'm not sure where the comedy aspects were. I was also disappointed when Ken and Barbie broke out into song in the final act. It seems that whenever Hollywood has a bad story then they turn it into a musical. This film was as shallow and one dimensional as a plastic doll who can't bend their knees. The characters were so boring. Nothing much happens and then I was just left waiting for the film to finish. I don't expect this film to win many awards. It was more of an idea than a film with substance. I suppose it's one saving grace was that it's very much in line with American consumerism and patriotic to the 1980's American ideals of beach culture and beauty. The film manages to capitalise and celebrate the bright 1980's fluorescent colour palette that was shovelled at teenage girls in the era, ala slap bands, rollerblades, Alf and fruity loops cereal. However, Barbie as a character seems to be stuck in the 1980's and is really outdated and boring in the 2020's. Some things should be left to age gracefully into history. Especially, a stiff plastic doll without much personality.",/review/rw9319915/?ref_=tt_urv

","Let's face it: this film is not supposed to be good. It certainly isn't supposed to offer much more than eye-candy and a few songs. Yet, 'Barbie' in its own way has come to house all the pieces we look for in a movie. For her first live-action story, Greta Gerwig managed to craft an experience that captures everything right, and everything wrong with what the doll has represented to generations of girls. Set design was a dream and at opening feels like the first time we saw Dorothy step into Oz. The cast carried a full load of heavy-hitters and Gosling's Ken made a few attempts to steal the show. Margot Robbie is the true star that shines as she gives much more attention, depth, and charisma than Barbie had any right to be - creating a 3D character that is both whimsical and disturbingly real. Although it is an entirely different think-piece to discuss gender roles, the fact remains that any authentic Barbie story cannot be told without it. Gerwig's real genius is that she is able to tell the story within the story without it feeling like a finger-wag. The fact is, the pacing and humor is more than enough for viewers to see themselves on both sides of the fence. Cunning, sharp, heartfelt, and hilarious, 'Barbie' is an open love letter to past, present, and future mothers and the ties that bind through the obligation of perfection. In the end - like its namesake - the film represents whatever you want it to be. After all, isn't that what she was made for?",/review/rw9319915/?ref_=tt_urv

The first hour was fun and had me laughing; the second hour - to me at least - started to drag a bit.

","I went into this movie thinking it would be super preachy and all about feminism, but I found that many people have had different views or takeaways from the movie. I interpreted the overall point of the movie to be that today's feminism has gone a little overboard and has put way too much pressure on women to feel like we have to be the career driven, leader boss b*itch to have a meaningful life. This movie voices that sometimes women (while respecting the women that do) don't want to be a leader, who's a mom and has the career. Sometimes we just want to be average and that's ok. I also felt the mother and daughter scenes in the movie tug at my heart and GG did a great job and adding those pieces throughout the movie. While I agree that it was annoying how the Kens were treated at the beginning of the movie, I felt the ending tied it all together. Overall, I enjoyed the movie. As humans I think we sometimes find ourselves wondering what was I made for? And even though this was referring to Barbie, it can be very relatable.",/review/rw9319915/?ref_=tt_urv

","Like many, I saw the ads and read the hype surrounding this movie. And who would walk away from the perfect summer time movie that features Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling? I mean just based on curiosty alone, what would a movie about a child's doll be about? So off to the movies we went. And after the first 2 minutes, I was already having a bad feeling about this one.....and I really wanted to like it. As expected, much of the movie happens in BarbieLand, a perfect little beach front community where everyone cherishes Barbie. Lots of singing and dancing, colorful scenery, character introductions and so forth. You wonder where the story is going and out of the blue comes the theme of death. So at this point, its no longer a kids movie IMO. And the story developes into Barbie's mission to cross in to the real world to save the person who's not happy with their Barbie doll. And by not happy, I mean depressed with thoughts of death. A pretty dark twist. So the mission begins with Ken and Barbie visiting LA. The story becomes a mix of several themes including female enpowerment, corporate greed and a push for a male dominated society. Although I chuckled a couple times, this movie never sucked me into the story to the point where I felt I wasnt in a theater, if you know what I mean. In fact, it felt like every 15 minutes I was hoping the movie was over. Margot and Ryan give outstanding performances, but the novelty of Barbieland quickly wears off, leaving the audience blasted with bubblegum pop music and watching Barbie disolve into an emotional trainwreck as she faces a personal identity chrisis. Of course, this becomes the stories message to tweens, that life's hard, its OK to fail and finding strength to succeed isnt easy, regardless of gender. Its an awkward movie in that it doesnt really fit for kids or adults, unless you ignore the story and just look at the pictures.",/review/rw9319915/?ref_=tt_urv

In theme, not execution. But it says a lot of quiet parts out loud. What we did with our Barbies. To them. Who is Ken anyway? Why is Ken? What is death and why does it matter? What is motivation and what is success? What is feminism and what is dementia t progress? Honestly. I would have thought you were blowing my horn.

Margot Robbie was the best pick for barbie and Ryan as Ken ( even tho some may disagree, but no just watch the movie he is perfect) it's really funny but also in some scenes very sad and relatable. I recommend watching this movie because of :
1. Humour the ending really caught me off guard ngl 😂
2. The movie not being dragged out and hard to watch
3. Interesting storyline even tho there are still those smarts that think it's basic. It's not. It made me realise some sadder things about characters like Ken and think about the human world
4. Message you gotta watch the movie for this one 😏
5. Great acting, dancing and yesss even singing its a bit basic and cheesy to put this to the list but I find it really impressive on how natural a human can act like a barbie.",/review/rw9319915/?ref_=tt_urv

","This is quite possibly the most overhyped movie ever. The plot is forgettable and a-lot of the films plot points contradict the overarching themes. Barbie was horrified by the patriarchal society in the real world however when she came back she helped create a matriarchy by appointing all positions of leadership to barbies and refusing to let kens sit on the senate. The ken's were objectified throughout the movie not being given any validation but when they took over barbie threw a tantrum and refused to sympathise with them. Also the barbie's had no objection to the ken's instilling a patriarchy and rolled over immediately conforming to their rules without a second thought. They were meant to be these strong feminist characters but they did not have a mind of their own and it took the monologue of a side character's superficial problems to bring them to their senses. These issues take away from the meaning of the film and overall the idea was executed poorly. The movie has some plus points, being an partially enjoyable comedy but is not worthy of the 8* ratings.

","Margot Robbie is the best possible choice to play Barbie and Ryan Gosling is terrific as Ken. It's a very interesting story and not one I would automatically expect from a Barbie movie, but I love how it dives deep into the complexities of gender roles. It shows the negative impacts that a society dominated by one certain gender can have (female in Barbie Land and male in the real world) and we see why it's important to try and understand everyone's perspective. I also love how this movie dives into men's mental health with Ken's arc. It's something that gets overlooked in society and I adore how we got to see Ken learn to come to terms with who he is without Barbie and realize that he is enough just being himself. The movie gives a great arc to Barbie as she tries to understand her purpose. She realizes that the world of extreme happiness that she has been raised in isn't what she wants anymore. There are so many beautiful scenes where Barbie experiences the highs and lows of everyday humanity and in the end she chooses that she wants to become a real human. At first she starts off thinking that she's a great role model because she is always happy and positive but learns there are so many complexities to life that she was oblivious to. She becomes prepared to take on the challenge of being a human because she is desperate to feel something real. It's a great story and Greta Gerwig did a brilliant job directing. The set designs are very impressive and lots of shots are very beautiful. The movie is also very funny and the details and references to Barbie as a brand show just how much care was put into this movie. The music is incredible, there are so many songs in here that are great, but Ryan Gosling's performance of I'm Just Ken and Billie Eilish's What Was I Made For are my favorites. They do a great job representing the themes of the movie.

","This movie is made for adults, not suitable for children. Despite its marketing campaign that could easily be mistaken for a fun, kid-friendly film, it is riddled throughout with adult language, sexuality, and mature themes. It's a surprisingly unrelenting work of misandry, toxic relationships, and alternative lifestyles coated in the pink plastic shell of a beloved toy. At times it's hard to determine whether the message of the film is more about depression, disappointment, or death as the reality of the human condition.

","Greta's satire that evidently seems like a promotion run of Mattel's creations, is beyond the pink dazzle. The sugary-adorable pastels, mostly the pink colour spreads all over the dreamy world of Barbie. Everything that makes it fancy, fizzy and fantastic are the production designs and costumes. Ebullience is lightened by the sparkling musical sequences. The Fabulous Margot Robbie as Barbie is the eminence of this Greta's clever and creative vision. The Cast is typically perfect to saturate in the fantasy. Ryan Gosling charmingly lends a kenergy in the story. The ridiculous banters strives all the way, sometimes little silly but mostly unveils the story's themes. There's a brief mention of Mattel's creation & how they flawed at a place when they aimed to represent a powerful figure. There's a slight malfunction between the fantasy and real world that alters different ideologies to flourish in the fun and laughs. The ideologies shapes into leading an unresolved fragment of humankind. The two contrasting portraits, the Patriarchy & Feminism comes in a fairy tale that once again liberalise the women and evokes them to voice up for themselves and their dilemmas & demands for a treaty for their existence and admiration which is partly void in the flawed-society. The sweet messages are beneath the glaring pink world, that adds a soul in the story. Barbie's exploration in finding the answer to the malfunction leads to many errands along the way. She realises the elegance of tears, her purpose and worth, being imperfect is normal and ultimately the self-discovery immerses in the conclusion. A pink jest is a celebration of womanhood as the flashes of memories flow. Gradually it reaches to hearts of millions with its resembling storytelling. It turns into a tender-mellow tale of Barbie, growing up to understand the sentiments of a human much more. Indeed this elegantly crafted and insightfully written tale drives to a sentimental ending.

","Didn't watch the trailer and went to see the Barbie movie, thinking it would be a regular comedy about a doll. I liked the idea of dressing up in pink with my daughter and going to a girly movie. But I was very surprised when I found out that there was a deep meaning hidden in the pink world of Barbie Land! The movie touches on women's issues: being always perfect, managing everything, being beautiful, perfect mothers, cooks, careerists and wives. The movie also shows men who don't know who they are without their women, cars, jobs. I cried, I was moved by the dialogues. I loved the movie! I was especially impressed by the moment at the bus stop, when Barbie sat next to an old lady and praised her for her beauty. The old lady smiled and said: I know :) It was so cute and wise! It made me realize that growing old is not scary if you love yourself as you are. You don't need to chase youth, there is beauty and dignity in every age. I am grateful to the directors Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach for making the Barbie movie not only a fun comedy, but also a deep drama about finding yourself and your place in the world. They showed that Barbie is not just a doll, but a heroine who can be anyone and do anything. They also honored the memory of Ruth Handler, who gave millions of girls the opportunity to dream and strive for the best. I think that the Barbie movie is not only a movie for children, but also for adults who want to go back to their roots and find their inner beauty.

","In one sense, this film was more inevitable than Thanos. What do you get when you're part of a society that fuels existential crises, by constantly eroding definitions and structures? Barbie and Ken aren't exactly human (they don't even have genitals); they're embodied ideas, and so they face this amorphous crisis of identity that pits their presuppositional views of a happy society against that of the ""real world."" But their perception of the real world is like seeing a plane for the first time and therefore thinking it's a dragon. So how much can an audience glean from the pontifications of characters who are essentially children? I would have greatly preferred scriptwriters more well-versed in sociology as well as comedy, writers who understand not only American ideals, and how those ideals have shifted, but the role that Barbie has played along the way. I get the sense that the writers here just KNOW Barbie had some impact, without really understanding much beyond that.

Not only that, but the wide spectrum of representation of connection between women was remarkable; from the shared struggle of patriarchal restraints we experience to the common childhood memories of playing with dolls. I have seen some critics who hate magic, fun, and women, be quick to hate on the heavy speech America Ferrera gives in the third act about standards women must meet.

It knows what it stands for, what it wants to say and what it represents. It's a work done by a woman, it's obvious in every dialogue and every frame. Mattel is very supportive of what it says, it's actually really forward of them that they enabled this to happen. Greta took a chance and rather than making just another studio movie, she crafted a masterpiece. ""Barbie"" is all about self-identity and discovery and it's a journey to accepting once self and loving it.

It's a movie by a female director with a clear vision and a clear goal, it's made with absolute love and respect for the source material and with an eye for every minor detail. ""Barbie"" is a movie made by someone who knows the Barbie doll. ""Barbie"" is a funny movie, it really is very funny and so much fun. Margot Robbie is ""Barbie"", you simply believe it.

Barbie herself ends up not solving her problem, still being confused, and staying in the real world when she wanted everything back to normal during the whole movie. That makes no sense whatsoever.

They stereotyped it all (women included) in a way that was very intentional and drove home some incredibly difficult aspects of the modern human condition. They took impossibly stressful expectations that society pushes on both sexes and made them light hearted and surprisingly emotional. As a woman, even though the situations with men in the movie were exaggerated and oversimplified, they were all incredibly reflective of so many of the experiences that I and countless other women have lived through. It was nice to be seen (and to be able to laugh and cry at how on point they were)... I very rarely feel that from a movie, much less from a movie about dolls that I hardly ever chose to play with as a kid. I think the only thing I was hoping for more of was a greater acknowledgment of some less binary identities. In my opinion there were so many opportunities to more than subtlety hint at diversity there.

Well, okay, fine - this could still turn out great, couldn't it? Barbie and her ""obviously pain in the neck"" Ken, who appeared more relatable to me than Barbie herself, embarked on a playful and lovely journey to the ""real world."" The CEO of Mattel kind of saved that real-world experience for me. Barbie meets a rebellious teen girl and her mother in a crisis and takes them back to Barbie Land, where Ken, who figured out that men can also rule the world, turned the pink glitter style into a ""Kendom."" So far, so good. What happened next was just annoying and confusing. I'm saying this as a 26-year-old woman. There were endless speeches about how hard it is to be a woman and a mother. And when Barbie decided to live as a human - the already known talk about how cruel human life can be. The only refreshing thing was Ken's battle and the song ""I'm just Ken."" The ever-popular Barbie turned out to be an aging woman who just can't get on with her life and treats the only person who is always by her side (her Ken) like trash, which was the worst for me personally.

Which is why after Ken brings the patriarchy from the real world almost everyone is on board. It's different and fun. Then when Barbie returns, Barbie and a couple of others use deception and manipulation to win back power. Just like some aspects (some, not all) of the patriarchy, deception and manipulation are evil too. Then after Barbie finally sees Ken's dilemma, instead of only focusing on herself, she supports him. It's Barbie and its Ken. The message of the movie is not down with the patriarchy, nor is it anti matriarchy. The message of the movie is life is hard, with ups and downs and then you die, so we should support each other.

The movie fights against the double standards women have themselves and about understanding yourself as an individual. To me, the most touching part was the end when it shows clips of women just laughing and enjoying themselves and I felt it had such a deep message to be proud that I am a woman.

","Barbenheimer? Who is the winner? Actually, when I thought about it, their are two completely different movies. Both of them are great, I will tell you why this movie is great, but the main point is that you can't just compare this two movies. Anyway, Greta Gerwig did an absolutely amazing job, and I was so surprised over how deep and emotional this movie really was. This is not made for kids, even if you could think this would be for kids, but no. Some sexual humor and a very complex moral that not every child would understand. The good things about Barbie is the valuable moral itself. They show you that the world and humanity, isn't perfect, and it is never going to be perfect, you just have to focus on how you are now. They showed how women were treated in centuries, and the big pressure on men and how they have to be in front of women, strong, reckless and to never show their feelings. That is something I wouldn't expect from this movie, I was very surprised, and the representation of men, Ken (Just Ken) as the main Ken played be Ryan Gosling, he did just an amazing job at showing how men are and their behaviour. Margot Robbie was the second big star, or the first, both of them were amazing, but she played with such a feeling and emotion. When Barbie, the main Barbie played by Margot, discovered that the world and the people in the world are not perfect, and that not everyone are like her, she was completely off. Margot Robbie showed that feeling in the exactly good way as it should be showed in. Besides the actors, the storytelling, scenography and music soundtrack was amazing. Sometimes it was a bit too much screaming, but that's not the point, this movie was awesome! This is a movie for everyone. If you like Barbie, this movie is for you, if you don't like Barbie, this movie is for you. This is a movie made for everyone, everyone can enjoy it, and I can't really understand why so many countries made this movie forbidden. This movie offers you so much moral, entertainment, and I think this was a great movie.",/review/rw9319915/?ref_=tt_urv

The music is a highlight here too which is sometimes hilarious and reminded me of the Lego movie in some ways. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are both pitch perfect here as well.

The serious shift felt a little too sudden when it could have benefitted from fleshing out the ""perfect"" life and the character dynamics of the barbies and Kens with more substance. Because I felt that was missing, the emotions Barbie was experiencing in the real world fell flat to me, which brings me to my second point.",/review/rw9319915/?ref_=tt_urv

Unfortunately, it struck out on all accounts. The much hyped visual experience and world building got old fast. The actors were so clichéd and pigeonholed that they were hard to watch (as you may have heard, Ryan Gosling is the star and most interesting character despite the movie name).

","Barbie, the doll that destroyed stereotypes and taboos to later generate new ones and destroy them again, arrives at the cinema for the first time and does so masterfully. ""Barbie"" is a film that portrays misogyny from the perspective of the famous doll, the script is a biting criticism of patriarchy, internal problems within feminism, family and social relationships, consumerism and existentialism, all full of humor, in some scenes with a lot of black humor and the result is excellent, capturing what it wants to convey to the public. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is magnificent and together with the production design they bring a fictional country full of fantastic and pink plastics. The soundtrack is tremendous, with a list of songs wisely chosen (with some exceptions). The cast is tremendous, Margot Robbie's performance is realistic and sentimental, proving to be the perfect Barbie in all aspects. Ryan Gosling plays Ken with humor and also gives him perfect dramatic nuances. America Ferrara as a working mother achieves a performance to remember, especially for her powerful monologue. Kate McKinnon gives a highly comic performance and an endearing character of a very unusual Barbie. Rhea Perlman pulls off an incredible performance wittily balancing comedy and drama. Ann Roth in a special participation of a single dialogue and a smile achieved a sublime and unforgettable performance. Helen Mirren with a voice acting as The Narrator describes everything with feeling and passion taking advantage of her imposing voice. Greta Gerwig's work as a director is genius, she manages to capture the ideas of the script, gives it her own style and pays homage to movie classics.

The movie relied a lot on sight gags that I thought fell flat. The ending seemed to come out of the blue and was a poor attempt at profundity. Margot Robbie IS the consummate Barbie, but she pretty much plays ""actress Barbie"" in everything she does, so it wasn't anything groundbreaking for her. I thought Gloria and Sasha were the best characters and the combination of their performances along with the costumes and sets are the reason I gave the movie any stars at all.

Robbie is the nominal center of attention who suddenly gets pangs of an existential dilemma which prompts her & Gosling, who has stowaway'd in her car, as she heads to the real world to get some answers. Reaching there, Robbie finds the axis of her feelings are coming from a Mattel employee, America Ferrara & to a certain extent her daughter, Ariana Greenblatt, but Robbie doesn't count on pesky Gosling to reach his own sense of male patterned nirvana as he gleans the real world moves along a patriarchal arc which he takes back home to remake their world in his own image which starts to affect real world Barbie products (Ken dolls are becoming more prominent) but more importantly Robbie & the rest of her Barbie compatriots standing in their own home turf.

In fact, when Barbie is mentioned, the role is well-accepted. Of course, Barbie is not the only character fully reflected in the movie. By writing Ken as a one-dimensional character and inserting a prominent role in the story, he significantly increased the directors of the movie games. Ryan Gosling had a great acting. Frankly, he manages to steal the heart of television in every scene on the screen. For the other Barbie and Ken players, the states didn't show much of a performance (Maybe Kate McKinnon).

However, this is neither a treatise nor a polemic. It's still primarily a fun, free-wheeling farce with Day-Glo colors and silly choreography filling up the screen with zestful energy informed by a knowing perspective. Margot Robbie is ideally cast in the title role as she epitomizes stereotypical Barbie. Ryan Gosling gives Ken the right level of disempowerment as he gets taken in by the lure of toxic masculinity.

There is a serious divide in the way people approach feminism and it is honestly really sad that people think that this movie is ""Pitting men against women"" and vice-versa. Although I do not agree with the ending statement of the movie, ""And the Kens one day will achieve as much power in the Barbie land as women hold in the real world"", but in the end Barbie land is really just a reflection of the real world, just opposite, in order to open people's eyes to the fact that yes, women are discriminated against still and that they do not hold much power and autonomy in our world even today.",/review/rw9319915/?ref_=tt_urv

","Any time a movie prioritizes messaging, there's an all too long history of the end result suffering, whether in terms of its storytelling, its general craftsmanship, or both. Broadly, this trend holds true even when a message is important, admirable, and agreeable. Case in point, last year's slasher 'They/them' was troubled in various ways, but above all in how immensely upfront it was about its otherwise gratifying messaging; sure enough, the writing suffered in turn. This 2023 film is not free of that same issue, for it is extremely, emphatically forthright and downright strident about the ideas at the root of the screenplay and which it wishes to convey; they're terrific ideas, but literally from the very beginning we see and hear exactly, indisputably, what the script wants to communicate. More than that, this is a picture that strives to be, say, and do a lot, and in fact it is, says, and does so much that it's a little overwhelming - I earnestly think the finished product would have benefited from some thoughts being left out so as to tighten the whole and assert greater focus. And though I somewhat repeat myself, it's well worth accentuating that the feature is majorly heavy-handed, with astonishingly little of the content being given a delicate, nuanced touch for the viewer to pick up on or feel for ourselves.

As a former Barbie connoisseur now in her 40's, I was curious how producers would carry this film. And since nothing is completely original now, I couldn't ignore the overtones similar to 1998's Pleasantville - with our female protagonist postulating the human world outside of ""Barbieland"". Alas, toward the third act, the movie seemed to whip into a full-fledged ""Mama Mia"" production and I wondered amusingly what the hell I was watching at times. There were parts that were downright silly (Ryan Gosling's performance as Ken was hilarious, but borderline over-the-top, to say the least). However, the profound messages of diversity, female empowerment, personal acceptance and loving thyself were ubiquitous (I mean, they REALLY stressed it from start to finish), and little girls across the globe should find the movie worthy of embracing.

","""Thus Spake Zarabarbie"" - that's the opening message as narrated by Dame Helen Mirren who gives us a potted history of the doll - from it's origins as an inanimate plaything of young girls to it's current status as an empowering conduit for young girls to emerge into society as uninhibited and aspirational beings with only the sky as the limit. Well, that's the philosophy in Margot Robbie's ""Barbieland"". A sterile sort of environment that lives it's life along the lines of a pink ""Groundhog Day"". Men? Well yes, there are - as embodied by the tanned, rippled and toned ""Ken"" (Ryan Gosling) but they are very much the in-app purchase in this world, with little purpose aside from augmenting a ""Barbie"". Strangely, one morning, the stereotypical ""Barbie"" finds she has lost some of her charm! She is flat footed, her endlessly elysian existence is fraying at the edges? What do do? See ""Weird Barbie"" (Emerald Fennell) and seek her sagely advice. That, however, she doesn't like. She must enter into the real world and find whoever is supposed to be playing with her - clearly not an happy girl - and see if she can cheer her up and restore the equilibrium. En route, she finds that her ever devoted ""Ken"" will join her and their arrival in the big city introduces both to a bewildering world of sexists, misogynists and cynics. The latter best exemplified by ""Sasha"" - her somewhat disenchanted owner. When the boss of Mattel (Will Ferrell) discovers her escape, he mobilises the whole of his organisation to get her back in her box whilst an equally disillusioned but newly engaged ""Ken"" heads back to his home realising that maybe the men don't have to live quite such understudy lives. Can she elude her pursuers long enough to befriend ""Sasha"", her much less cyclical mother ""Gloria"" (America Ferrera) and then get home before both of her world's are alien to her? This is good fun, this. Gosling is a talented actor who can also churn out a decent power ballad (there are a few) and there is the oddest of chemistries here between him and an very much on-form Robbie who puts her heart and her soul (and loads of joyous/bemused facial expressions) into this role. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have written a witty script that pitches the naive and the innocent in with the venal and the observational. It swipes at all things sexist - and not just from the woman's perspective either - and though it does ridicule the restrictions society has put on the historical progression of women through the ranks of corporate America, it does so in a positive and enjoyable satirical manner. Will Ferrell - I can take him or leave him - is really only adequate as the epitome of the male dominated company structure but there is quite a nice set of scenes with Rhea Perlman (for ever ""Carla"" from ""Cheers!"") who portrays the inventor - if that is the word - of the whole ""Barbie"" concept, and who knits it all nicely together towards the end.

It was cool how they incorporated the Barbie box and different outfits, something I loved as a child. I also thought TV Barbie was a blast from the past (90s baby here), and learned about other dolls like Midge, Skipper, and Alan. Also... they didn't do poor Midge any justice.

I even enjoyed the over-the-top portrayal of the patriarchy. It was hilarious. However, I felt the ending fell flat. Maybe they were trying to show how ridiculous the patriarchy was by putting in reverse, but I felt like they acted too dismissive of the plight of the Kens, to the point that it didn't feel satirical but rather like actually not acknowledging them and their voice at all. It felt like in giving women power and a voice they ended up actually mistreating the Kens and laughing it off as funny. Sure, they gave them some minor administrative role at the end, but the attitude when they did it was just so very wrong. Like it ended with the Barbies doing exactly what we complain about men in society doing to women. Not that it happened in the middle as part of their growth. It happened as part of the finale.

It does start off cute, but about halfway through the movie it gets very heavy handed with politics, and becomes a complete battle of the sexes. This lasts all the way until the end of the movie. The political messaging starts to become like beating a dead horse by the time the movie is over. What I thought was going to be a fun, relaxing night at the movies turned into what seemed like a political debate. Such a disappointment! I feel like there was so much potential for this to be such a great, fun movie, it really is a shame how it was turned into a battle of the sexes, women are perfect and can do no wrong while men are complete losers showdown. I am a woman myself, and all that political messaging in the movie was so unnecessary. It would have been completely fine to keep the messaging at how girls can grow up to do whatever career they want and they don't have to look a certain way to be beautiful, etc., but this movie was just too over the top with the messaging of women are perfect, women are better than men, etc. It was just all so unnecessary.

I myself had the entire entourage,(and still have them, almost 40 years later) so it was much more endearing and relatable. I liked the underlying themes, which added depth and perspective that I didn't expect at all. I think that taking very complex and deep topics about societal issues and trying to keep them light is quite often better than delving too deep into these topics . It gives people a chance to think, feel and relate to it, without having the movie become too heavy, or being 'too much'.

I understand that men feel as though Ken deserved a bit of leadership ad power, but the Barbies built that land. Us woman love this movie because it opens up our imagination of what we can be, and though people says "" Oh, they could've let the Ken's have a bit of ownership and power"" But when Barbie went to the real world, you could see from most women's perspective of what their life is like on a daily basis 'not saying all men are like this stereotype'.

It felt as if it was missing that connection the audience/viewers want to receive and feel from beginning to end, forgetting you're watching a movie, that spark that makes you get lost in the story in a best kind of way. I had beyond high hopes for this film. I was truly ecstatic to see it, and was rooting for it every step of the way... all the way till I stood up from my theater seat as the credits rolled. I had this glooming feeling of confusion(not because I did not get it) and unfulfillment. I literally felt bad for wanting to immediately turn to my sister, whose birthday it was, and ask her what she thought because I knew I'd than have to answer that same question to not only her but to everyone else that was going to ask me what I thought. The trailers and hype around it presented it as if it was going to be a hilarious and powerful satire indie film that would go down in cinema history. Yes it had an incredibly outstanding lineup cast, inspiring director and writers, but it was just not all it was hyped up to be. I'm definitely in the target audience, so there's no judgment that should be passed on that thought, I just wasn't that captured by it. This is all MY PERSONAL OPINION, but I did not find it funny, I literally caught myself forcing laughter at some of the scenes that were supposed to be funny because I felt bad the jokes were just not landing, and I really did want to like it. It felt alittle all over the place at times, and rushed in multiple scenes that felt there should have been more there. Yes, there was alot of great speeches that were moving, but sometimes it felt like there were so many it took away from others and you got lost in all the underlying meanings. It felt like someone was saying ""look over here, now over here, no back over here!"" The cast was good, visually appealing, and unique, but the movie as a whole just felt lacking. There was substance, but it got lost in all the messages and lessons it wanted us to take from it. Not something I would just put on to watch multiple times.

This movie touches a lot of parts about womanhood that we rearly get to see on the big screen, it critizes and in someways explains the patriarchy in a vey obvious way, whitch makes me think that the (mostly) men who are complaining about it have probably seen the movie with their eyes closed.",/review/rw9319915/?ref_=tt_urv

974,21 July 2023,moviesfilmsreviewsinc,10," Greta shows real power of woman in Barbie
","Greta Gerwig's Barbie explores creation myths in Barbieland, a parallel universe populated by Mattel dolls. The director uses the toy conglomerate's vast archive and successful products as tools to create a rich and weird material. The movie is a clever send-up of Barbie dolls and their legacy, featuring light-hearted jokes that poke fun at Mattel, the doll's lore, and the contradictions of our sexist society. The director's storytelling is impressive, and the film's humor is both lighthearted and chuckle-worthy. Gerwig's Barbieland, created by Sarah Greenwood and Jacqueline Durran, is a pink fever dream with funky compositions by Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt, bubblegum anthems by Dua Lipa, Nicki Minaj, and Ice Spice. The film features plastic trees and identical two-story Barbie dream homes, with flying being the preferred mode of transportation. The production design and costuming are exceptional, showcasing Gerwig's passion for details and her ability to create a dreamlike world. Barbieland is a feminist utopia in which Barbies serve as presidents, Supreme Court members, doctors, physicists, Nobel prize winners, and cancer cures. The dolls are not structurally different from our world, but they are represented by political fantasy and decade-dependent what-ifs. Barbie has gone to space, could vote, and own property before many human women, and her appearance has changed to mirror society's beauty politics. The representational doll has become an extension of political fantasy, reflecting the beauty politics of society. Gerwig features a cast of Barbies, including Issa Rae, Emma Mackey, Alexandra Shipp, and Hari Nef. Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) is the protagonist, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed Barbie created by Ruth Handler. Her Ken counterpart, Ryan Gosling, is portrayed with humor and heart. They are a version of Eve and Adam, with their fall being dramatic. Barbie finds her perfect life hampered by existential thoughts and seeks answers from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a doll with a traumatic history. Stereotypical Barbie, with Ken, heads to real-world Los Angeles to find her little girl. The relationship between Barbies and their human owners is tenuously outlined, so it's best not to think too deeply about how it all works. Robbie's performance in Gerwig's Barbie highlights the tension between Barbie as an object and subject. Her expressive eyes and physical presence reveal the human world's forces, while her rigid presence in Barbieland suggests she's not less rigid in the real world. Despite the director's skill in capturing deeper themes, the film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest it ultimately serves a brand. The film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest the film serves as a brand. Gerwig's film Barbieland is a mix of fun and emotional depth, with a tension between keeping Barbie entertaining and blending her source material with previous projects. After a detour, Barbie returns home to find Ken's patriarchal knowledge has transformed Barbieland. The screenplay, by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, avoids familiarity and mockery, but the moments that aren't just funny are buried in important monologues, making the gestures feel politically hollow. The film's mandate is too ambitious, making it feel politically hollow.",/review/rw9319915/?ref_=tt_urv

The all the way up button in the elevator, the immediate response of the director of Mattel, that they had to get Barbie in the box, meeting the ghost of an old lady.

They travel to the real world after Barbie starts developing cellulite and worrying about death. Ken learns about patriarchy in the real world, especially from the clever corporate types who affect an image of equality but use this as a cover to carry on in the old manner. Ken returns to Barbieland intent on turning it into a Kendom and turning the world upside down. Barbie faces the all male Executive board of Mattel where the CEO (Ken Ferrell) defends his policies but literally tries to put Batbie in a box. . Cutting satire, great humour in a whipsmart script with wonderful fake pastel sets in Barbieland. The themes and set decoration bring Don't Worry Darling and Asteroid City to mind. Kate McKinnon is Weird Barbie who helps Stereotypical Barbie to solve her personal problems and to battle against the Kendom. I'll have to see this again. I reckon to properly appreciate all the jokes, irony and satire. Greta Gerwig takes no prisoners as she Directs and Co-Writes (with Noah Baumbach) this comic masterpiece. 9/10.",/review/rw9319915/?ref_=tt_urv

","First, I can't believe I went to this movie. My 18 year old daughter wanted to go so I said ok. I watched the first 20 minutes in disbelief - with my internal voice asking, ""How did this movie ever get made?"" The story is stupid. The acting is bad. The movie tries to be a cross between The Wizard of Oz, La La Land, Being John Malkovich and The Truman Show but fails on all attempts. Is it a musical, comedy, drama, spoof? Yes to all. But again, it fails miserably on all attempts. Oh - and have I mentioned how we women are supposed to be superior to men? Like the Woo Girls in HIMYM, it's just sad. I'll never get my time or money back, so I recommend you just save your money and go see something else. I just can't believe this film has good reviews.

However, I feel like the plot is at some places a little bit weak and it feels as though this film sets out on a crusade to educate you on the injustices in the real world and does mainly focus on feminism and issues surrounding that topic but it does also cover topics that aren't specific to feminism. Overall, I do not mind the role of feminism in this story and the mother daughter relationship as well as the whole female focused parts of this movie because it is simply amazing and at the end of the day we have to consider this is a movie about Barbie so all those topics are perfectly acceptable in this movie. For example, if this was a movie about some traditionally boyhood toy you would expect it to embrace that in its narrative.

","'Barbie (2023)' truly is an accomplishment, a shockingly successful blend between a mass-appeal blockbuster and a strange slice of surreal existentialism. There isn't anything quite like it and, although it essentially serves as one giant advertisement for its eponymous doll, it feels like a genuine piece of almost outsider art with a great sense of humour and a ton of heart. It's an incredibly well-crafted feature. The cinematography, set design and costuming all hit the nail squarely on the head, to the point that the pastel plastic aesthetic of Barbieland is so compelling and so complete that it honestly feels as though the movie has become live-action once Barbie and Ken make their way to the real world (even though the flick has been live-action since its first frame). The performances help with this, too, as the actors not only throw themselves from head to toe into the absurdity needed to fully embody the unreal nature of their characters but also deliver their lines with pitch-perfect timing and genuine emotion. All the Barbies and all the Kens (and Allan) are great, but Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling truly are the stars here. The former is absolutely brilliant, nailing the emotional dichotomy of her character's mindset as she undergoes her journey, and the latter just seems as though he's having a great time, living that quintessential Ken lifestyle without an ounce of embarrassment. It's also nice to see Will Ferrell being funny again, popping up as a CEO who seems like he just might be Buddy the Elf all grown up (it's not like he ever stopped being funny, per se, but he's been in some rough movies recently), and America Ferrera is great in her more down-to-Earth yet refreshingly honest role.",/review/rw9319915/?ref_=tt_urv

The dialogue is really funny and the musical numbers are just pure perfection. Absolutely adored Barbie. I did go to theaters to watch this movie and to my surprise, I saw a lot of young kids watching it. There was a lot of adult topics, such as sexism and problems women face in society, and the patriarchy and the matriarchy, and slightly inappropriate jokes that were put into the movie which I don't think kids should be watching. It seems like it's marketed towards young children when really, teenagers and adults are really the audience it was intended for. This was only a slight problem, and other than that, I think this movie was a masterpiece and definitely makes a great movie night. It was emotional but hilarious and relatable and Barbie won't disappoint.",/review/rw9319915/?ref_=tt_urv

","What a cinematic experience. The mediatic effect that this film is having and will have is beyond imagination. I don't know where to start. I feel like Greta is kind of an underrated director but one of the most unique voices in Hollywood. This film is iconic. Using the character and icon of Barbie to tell and send such strong messages is something that not everyone can do. Throughout the film I was always connecting it to Disney's Soul, due to particular sequences that were so strong and that convey the same message (Barbie experiencing the real life for the first time): life is unique, a beautiful gift that it's worth exploring and enjoying despite its suffering - using this solid base to talk about crucial matters like politics, patriarchy, feminism, life as a woman in all its aspects, all in a really enjoyable, beautifully crafted comedic way. Barbie (and the married writers) manages to unite different kinds of genres (musical - Ryan Gosling is sublime in musicals... you know what I mean -, bits of war sequences and the dramatic layer) in a special way. This movie is near to perfection. The epilogue really adds to that perfection, with a heart-wrenching soundtrack by Billie Eilish and some stunning visuals and another expected brilliant performance by Margot Robbie. It's her year, and she deserves all of it. To summarise the film: I AM KENOUGH!",/review/rw9319915/?ref_=tt_urv

The movie starts out pretty well but as soon as the actual story kicks in it goes off the rails. I read reviews claiming this was a poignant and deep film but instead it feels shallow and trite. I don't disagree with what the movie is trying to say (I'm a woman) however I felt like it would have been much more profound if they showed it, rather than had speech after speech saying essentially the same thing. Margot and Ryan are spectacular at their roles and the soundtrack is great. Visually it's top notch. It should have been a kid's movie but they wanted to go into more than one lane. So IMO it's not a must see for kids or adults. The trouble with a lot of these films that wax on about the patriarchy, inequality and how hard life is are almost always written and produced by the elite 1 percenters. This film is no exception.

Helen Mirren's narration was well-paced, not overly-intrusive, and she dryly delivered a line that resulted in the audience erupting into laughter as I am sure we were all thinking the same thing as Margot was delivering a touching monolog about 3/4 through the film. The entire cast clicked: Ryan Gosling can play just about any role and his portrayal of Ken is another notch on his belt of challenging, versatile, and memorable performances. Kate McKinnon nailed her part and if there is such a thing as perfect casting, she was perfectly cast. I wanted to present an Academy Award to. America Ferrera when she finished her heartfelt reflection of what it is like to be a woman these days. Finally, the music was brilliantly matched to the mood of the film. I didn't expect the music to be so wonderful and it went a long way to infusing an emotional essence into what otherwise may have come across as a technicolor cartoonish fantasy.

What this film is about is men and women, this movie encapsulates the state of the modern western world. It grapples with the weightiest of issues with deft skill, and incredible fearlessness. It shows men in the modern world as they are (on the whole), and it shows women in the modern world as they are (on the whole), and it shows why and how, and the consequences of, men holding on to the old order - it shows how men infantilize themselves, constantly looking for validation, becoming macho characatures, aping some old forgotten code which has died, in the hope to attract women who have moved on and are looking for something different. It hints at the violence and culture of fear that lurks behind the surface of narcissistic charm.

Some very strong performances and not just Ryan Gosling, despite what most reviews say, but of course any film with Helen Mirren, (even as 'only' narrator) has kudos to begin with. A fun film that makes you think as an adult, but that kids will also enjoy. I went with my 19 year old daughter and we laughed out loud and shed an unexpected tear. Music is upbeat, choreography is very slick, colours vibrant and the fulm is surprisingly well shot. Hats off to Mattel for taking the plunge and goning with it.

","I would not recommend this movie. Nothing happened really. It felt like a very long commercial for Mattel with all the different Barbie's you can buy. And it wasn't even a fun commercial. It had no meaning at all. The one thing that had meaning was the speech of Gloria (America Ferrera) about how women will never be enough ever because they're a woman. If I'd heard that as a little girl I would've thought what's the point in trying to change it, but I'm a grown woman and I know how far we've come already. And that was about 2 minutes of the 2 hours. I never laughed but cringed a few times. I think it could've had great potential but it just didn't get it. The actors were maybe right but the story wasn't there. I also didn't get the weird play of Will Ferrell. Why was the Mattel CEO so weird? Did I miss something?

This lead to ken being the villain and no it was not Will Ferrel character as the bad guy as he wanted to keep barbie land the way it was not to have ken take over so it was in fact ken to believed to be the bad guy.

To find the answers she is looking for, Stereotypical Barbie must venture out into the real world, accompanied by her Ken, played by Ryan Gosling. On the plus side, the production design is striking. Barbieland is visually interesting, managing to feel fake, but lived in at the same time. The actors seem to have fun in the roles they are playing, Ryan Gosling's Ken being a stand out, making the best of the material he has. Margot Robbie also fulfills the role at playing a believable Barbie. Unfortunately, the overall execution of the film was disappointing. Most of the humor didn't land for me, though it did have its moments. Then there is the mixed messaging regarding gender roles. The film clearly states what it is trying to say (not subtle at all), but at the same time, undermines it through poor writing and characterization. Likewise, other attempts for the story to get deep end up falling flat by getting in its own way. While Barbie has its moments, it ends up getting held back by poorly executed ideas.

That's because I gave them their personalities just as the girls who play Barbies today give their dolls their personalities. Even if they had taken a script from one of the popular animated Barbie movies, such as Barbie and the Mermaid Tail"" and used it with the real actors, the movie would have been much better in my opinion.

","The Barbie movie got a lot of buzz from critical praise but I was intrigued even before that because there were stories about how it had quite the journey through development. I don't know what the previous versions would have looked like but I wanted to start with how Greta Gerwig's version is structured. It would have been pretty easy to play to formula writing and developing the script, to just repackage a popular framework and insert Barbie with some different touches (paint it pink and glam it up a little). But the creative team wasn't content to do just that here, my favourite part of Barbie is the unconventional directions the plot shoots off in. Barbie coming to the real world could have been predicted but the parallel journey of Ken, Barbie bonding with Gloria and Sasha, the odyssey that the Mattel executives go on are so off-kilter and fresh. It's all firmly tongue-in-cheek as well, the movie is deliberately poking fun at both itself and the system (including the corporate owners of the Barbie brand Mattel). Is there the occasional misstep? Sure, but this movie was so rare that while I could have nitpicked and poked at inconsistencies, I didn't want to. Barbie encourages you strap in for a ride and I can forgive the occasional bump in the journey if you deliver the goods. With such a silly tone and some well-intentioned rhetoric, Barbie absolutely does that and more.",/review/rw9319915/?ref_=tt_urv

","Alas, my high hopes were crushed. When i heard about this project, I saw the opportunity, and expected, rather hoped for, an utterly ridiculous over the top comedy where dollified actors could come up with some novel situations. I wanted to see what kind of comedic chops Gosling would trot out. Instead, after a razzmatazz showbiz intro, dancing dolls and high energy, the sad, busy, and quizzical plot unfolds as a very sorry melodrama. An emotionally vulnerable and beautiful but pitiful Barbie, and a truly oafish Ken, have passed through a ""Dimensional Membrane"" onto the earth plane, into a reality just as bizarre and unrealistic as the Barbie-Dimension, and the two doll-humanoids find themselves maladaptive and disliked, even persecuted. And they have come looking for a solution to an unpleasant sort of problem. This just isn't funny. It's pretty much a reworking of Judy Garland in OZ, way out of her element, trying to find the Ruby Slippers. In fact, it was a deformation of her feet as a Doll in Barbieland, that kicks off this whole sorry setup. Now I have to ask myself why I was expecting a comedy? Well, because the advertising suggested something ludicrous. When you see Will Ferrell doing pratfalls and the entire surreal pink Landscape of Barbie Land, Gosling with idiotic facial expressions and gestures, and Barbie presented as a very sexualized Super-Bimbo, sort of a witless Mae West, (who was very witty), I thought some very funny stuff was coming down the pike. Nope. I wouldn't say avoid it, but I would say it never really finds it's tone, and doesn't live up to its advertised premise. The crowd around me wanted to laugh, that was clear, and was struggling to find something funny in things that just weren't. This must have cost a fortune to produce.

The acting is average really, I suppose that Robbie and Gosling tried their hardest but clearly the script failed them as it all makes zero sense. It feels like a string of clips put together rather than a real film, it's all disconnected and disjointed.

If someone in the company had written the first draft, I would have believed it. Second, the ""rules"" of this made-up world were vague and constantly changing. The filmmakers ripped off Wes Anderson's settings but didn't comprehend the unity in his designs, stories, and performances. Wes Anderson always feels like he's about to break the fourth wall but never does. ""Barbie"" kept breaking it over and over so that it was near impossible to fully immerse yourself in its world.

","Despite the strong commercial tone, it is still possible to perceive that we are watching a film by Greta Gerwig. And the undeniable feminist tone exists through the presence of this female director - in addition to Margot Robbie herself as a producer. ""Barbie"" has sharp and intelligent comments on the dynamics between men and women over time and also on how these social roles are seen and problematized today. And the film does it with a big heart: the story is genuinely fun, with a humor that walks between acidity and innocence, but also moves with the existential journey of its protagonists, reserving touching moments and provoking reflections, especially in its final stretch. Debauchery is the great ally of Gerwig and Baumbach to deal not only with sexism, but also with the ""corporate"" issue. It won't be strange if you catch yourself thinking ""how did Mattel let this film see the light of day?""

The film also touches on the importance of embracing diversity and dismantling societal barriers. The movie's production design deserves applause, staying true to the beloved Barbie toys while ingeniously utilizing their features to propel the story forward. Margot Robbie delivers a phenomenal performance as Barbie, injecting depth and nuance into a character often dismissed as one-dimensional. Ryan Gosling, as Ken, complements the film with his adept portrayal, enhancing the chemistry between the characters, while America Ferrera's character brings a layer of relatability to the story.

It presents an optimistic world that is all facade, and if you peel away the layers, you are reminded of the reality that things are not so great. You could say that there is some level of men-bashing here, but that is all in service to how Mattel has chosen to portray the Ken doll as mere accessory to Barbie. So the movie doubles down on that, and with the comedic talent of Ryan Gosling, the movie gets to up the ante on the patriarchy satire. I especially like the part when Ken learns and practices to wave his finger 'no' at a female assistant. As for the casting of Barbie, Margot Robbie does a great job and truly fits the Barbie look. However in my mind the celebrity actress most physically resembling Barbie has always been 1970s Priscilla Barnes from ""Three's Company."" And kudos to America Ferrera's funny, nuanced portrayal of a mom having an existential crisis. How about that monologue?

","As one of the most anticipated films of the year, Barbie has managed to meet all audience expectations -especially cinephiles - and make it the most daring film of the year. Director Greta Gerwig (supported by screenwriter Noah Baumbach) doesn't just deliver a successful portrayal of all aspects of this popular icon: colorful set designs, stunning costumes and make-up, great music (they all sing!), the history of the Barbie doll, but also social commentary and philosophical analysis on existentialism, patriarchy, feminism, diversity, inclusion and all that packaged in sarcasm in the modern sense. As a film, Barbie delivers it all: fun, excitement and seriousness. The casting of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as Barbie and Ken is also the right choice.

","In the hands of another filmmaker, a ""Barbie"" film could have been a bland or soulless cash-grab just seemingly made to sell more of the iconic Mattel doll. But cinephiles know that Greta Gerwig's short-but-no-less-impressive track record of writing and directing is nothing short of superb, having made two outstanding films (2017's ""Lady Bird"" and 2019's ""Little Women."") Gerwig's films are always rooted in deep emotional affection and a profound understanding of womanhood with a level of emotional authenticity rarely seen in major Hollywood films. These levels of depth in her films are complemented by exceptionally clever and often funny writing. Needless to say, her take on ""Barbie"" is exceptional and certainly lives up to the seemingly earth-shattering hype. Gerwig and Baumbach's satirical screenplay is consistently hilarious from beginning to end, while depicting and analyzing themes related to feminism in a thoughtful and profound way. The film brilliantly threads the needle between being summer popcorn entertainment and being something far more original, creative, insightful, and clever than simply just that.

","I'm expecting to either love or hate this as I press play and smile at the pink Warners logo. As we settle into the opening 2001 parody scene, I quickly decide this will be love. As intros go, it is masterful, with a giant Barbie (Margot Robbie) overseeing small children smashing dolls while Helen Mirren narrates. Let's skip past the fact that in many ways it's a two hour advert, for that is missing the point entirely. And to miss the point here is bloody lazy. Barbieworld is a retina searing planet of positivity. Everyone leading their best life, having the best day, waving, smiling. Well apart from Ken (Ryan Gosling) who has something of an inferiority complex. It's not his world after all. Barbie is changing though, slowly slipping out of her stereotypical perfectness and into dun dun dunnnn ""thoughts of death"". With the help of Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon) it's explained that whoever is playing with Barbie in the real world is sad and she needs to go there to fix things. Cue the cutting comedy overload as Barbie... and Ken (of course) try to negotiate an upside down reality where sexism and the patriarchy runs rampant. Not only is this a great film with a wonderful cast, half of which seem to have been poached from Sex Education. It's the sort of film that would stand up to repeated viewing. That's not to say it's complex, but if you're expecting simple slick surface, you'll need to take that but with some sharp satire, that jumps through parallel universes. It's an existential trip, with twists, beautiful revelations and bonkers nightmares, that will make you smile, laugh out loud (seriously I nearly choked), cry and... think. All whilst being easily accessible. Robbie and Gosling are magnificent. Robbie always is, but I've struggled with Gosling in the past. Here though he gets to show some range and he delivers. Oh and can we talk about Michael Cera as Ken's mate Allan. What a marvellous role. He's a deft little pallet cleanser in a sometimes breakneck narrative. In a world of Barbie's and Ken's, you want to be Allan. This isn't a film about a doll and there's a reason this was a box office smash. It is utterly brilliant from start to finish.

Also this is a misrepresentation of the real world, as a woman with a career and decent income, I can tell you I in fact have more privilege than some of my male colleagues.

The story transitions from Barbieland to Ken-run world and then back to Barbie and the connections with the real world are well explained. This movie is a must watch with your family. It has some sexual connotations but not much of them in detail. Watch it with your Barbie and/or Ken and your entire family. I highly recommend this movie!",/review/rw9319915/?ref_=tt_urv

Also a great supporting cast including Ferrell, Cena, Cera, Ferrera, Liu, McKinnon, just to name a few. It was thoroughly entertaining but a few segments were a bit too preachy on feminism, but that's to be expected when it's a Barbie movie. This film had great costume and set designs and will win Oscars for those two categories for sure. It will most likely be nominated in all the major categories.

","Both ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" (yes, 'Barbenheimer') were playing at the local theater for a loooong time last year - for a small theater, they get the first-run films. I wanted to see ""Oppenheimer"" because I like Nolan's work, but I couldn't sit for 3 1/4 hours in a theater; and I had no interest in ""Barbie"". But then the reviews started coming out, so I asked for both movies (in Blu-Ray) from family for Christmas, and I got them. I watched ""Barbie"" first, and started laughing my ass off almost immediately - there are several 'steals' in the movie, referencing other movies, and the opening (from ""2001: A Space Odessy"") was the first (others include ""West Side Story"" and ""Monthy Python and the Holy Grail""), and I started laughing out loud... not good when other people in the house are trying to sleep. The tagline is exact: ""She's everything, he's just Ken""... in Barbieland, she has it all, while Ken is just Ken, mainly interested in 'beach' (and the line 'beach off' is funny). It's a female dominated society, where Ken is just Ken, not even welcome at Girl's Night... but then Barbie has to travel to the real world (the whole travel method is silly and so Mattel), where the roles are reversed, which gets Ken thinking. He gets back to Barbieland first, and implements what he's found to turn it into a male oriented domain (cowboys, horses and trucks, no surprise... the movie goes for a lot of stereotypes, while at the same time slapping them down). Mattel wants to 'cure' Stereotypical Barbie by putting her in a box... wow; shut her off and turn her into a typical female from the 50's. Will Ferrell has fun as the President of Mattel, with his pink drumsticks (never explained - I guess I didn't get that joke). The old woman on the bench... that was a good scene. The Kens fighting on the beach, the one Ken trying to give mouth-to-mouth to his horsey... plenty of scenes that are silly. In the end, it returns to the status quo - the Kens had their shot at changing things, but end up going back to their usual roles, which is the main theme of the movie, people getting trapped in their 'given' place in society, no hope for change. Near the end, when the Barbies 'deprogram' each other and President Barbie (Issa Rae) shouts out ""mother f***ers"" (bleeped, with the Mattel logo over her words) was startling, but at the same time, on point for the movie. Yeah, it's a movie about societal change, and expected gender roles, but it's done with so much humor and irony that it's fun. The fact that what people do (or feel) in the real world when playing with their Barbies isn't a new idea, but it's done well here. Margot Robbie (she's usually good) and Ryan Gosling (I've never liked him, but he does a good job in this) carry the film, but there are plenty of other good roles in this. Rhea Perlman as Ruth Handler, the woman who invented Barbie, and various other known names. If you sit there and coldly analyze it, yes, it can seem preachy... but it's preaching to the choir in most cases, and it's done with humor (and some pathos); definitely worth watching again.",/review/rw9319915/?ref_=tt_urv

1574,23 July 2023,bloomwu,8," Greta Gerwig is My Favorite Director
","I never had high expectations for the film due to the number of just-okay films that have come out this past year, but Greta never disappoints- Lady Bird, Little Women, and now Barbie! The movie is surely a Gerwig classic. It is amazing how the outright un-serious, campy film is able to tackle such serious and complicated real-world issues. Naturally, there is a satirical exaggeration of society to convey the point of the story but was executed with a conceptually clever approach. The writing carried witty humor, strong character development, and heartfelt experiences- all shined ever so brightly with the array of superb performances. Margot Robbie's performance throughout the film revealed the depth of such a character that can often be seen as superficial. The same can be said for Ryan Gosling's Ken. (SPOILERS) It is clear that everything Ken has done to Barbieland (""bringing patriarchy"") was in a way to shape his own sense of identity and self worth, what he feels he often lacks in Barbieland. The film features a multitude of well-known actors that portray a great deal of what a Barbie can be. The set and costumes bring viewers the nostalgia of their childhoods and how this life in a Barbie dream house (and her clothes) were extremely coveted by young girls. On the other hand, it shows how Barbieland is not all it is thought out to be. I was pleasantly surprised at how the dance numbers were reminiscent of old Hollywood sound-stage musicals that we never really see anymore. This film review would not be complete without an honorable mention to America Ferrera's performance. Her monologue's feminist themes are reminiscent of Saorise Ronan's monologue from Little Women. It was delivered at just the right pacing and intensity, resonating with audiences. While the message is not at all new, many women especially feel heard. The film does a wonderful job of blending the inclusive comedy with previous or subsequent scenes that make viewers tear up- the simultaneous laughing and crying sort. Overall, ""Barbie"" is a fun, glittery, social commentary satire about female identity; the feminism of hyperfemininity, authenticity, and community; and what it means to be human in our messed-up, chaotic world.

","Firstly, as a general opinion, I can say that I didn't want to watch the Barbie movie due to various comments and, at some point, the incredible and, at the same time, exhausting advertising that led to it being overloaded in its release year. Seven months later, I decided to watch it, and although I'm not a filmmaker but I'm cinephile by hobby, I can say I've seen many good movies and award-winning productions with positive reviews. Barbie confidently joins those ranks. What I mean is that while Barbie isn't the movie of the century, it can position itself among great productions beyond surface-level judgments.",/review/rw9319915/?ref_=tt_urv

","I feel like the idea of the connection between the Barbie and the Real worlds could be executed more interestingly, the Ken and the Ken war parts took too much time in the story, in my opinion. And all that Mattel part was just super weird, still don't know what the point of that chase even was. So the movie has several problems combined: human vs doll, real women vs imagined perfect women, Ken's crisis, etcetc, so it became a mess in the end of it all, with no clear direction. I thought that the fact that Barbie started having thought of her other would be developed by them both working on it together and coming to a solution, but that didn't really happen.",/review/rw9319915/?ref_=tt_urv

","Initially I wasnt so sure about how this movie would be, and whether it would overly focus on the idea of a Barbie doll, stopping it from extending to a resonant deep meaning. However, I was quickly proven wromg as we see the procession of Barbies life going from 'perfect' to 'realistic' showing us that we really are similar, makimg the movie much more pleasurable (in my eyes) and allowimg us to connect with her, them going to the human world and Ken going back with new ideas further related the movie to the real world as we felt some level of pity for Ken as he had been forced to feel this way for so long but also felt anger and confuaion as to why he was ruining this perfecr world woth clearly dysfunctional ideas, given that he knew how it felt. The ending was very satisfying as it brought closure to the topic at hand and also taught audiences a true lesson about society and the world generally, elevating it from a simple childish movie, without sacrificing the barbie feel with the various, sprinkles whimsical and funny moments which acted as a reset for the tone, without causing you to forget what had happened!

","Definitely different than what I was expecting. My first take away was ""wow that was so SURREAL AND WEIRD!"", I felt like I was in a Kurt Vonnegut style absurdity film sprinkled with a ton of sugar. But I can't say I hated this movie. I can't say I loved it. I think for me it was the sloppiness of the ever changing tones I disliked. One minute I'm appreciating the absurd, over the top, Adult Swim style humor and then BAM!, I'm hit with political messaging about gender roles. I find myself settling into the deeper meaning and appreciating that and BAM! I have to forget about that and deal with Will Ferrel and men in suits on roller blades...back to silly. And then at the very end there's this shoe-horned in third element of Barbie deciding she wants to go to the real world...whaaaa?? And then that's it. It's almost like they were trying to achieve what Pleasantville did only this movie did it WAY sloppier. Because Pleasantvilles writing contained elements of depth, human emotion, beauty, lessons on life and politics and gender roles wrapped up in an artsy film-making package. Whereas Barbie almost feels like it was written by AI. (Was that deliberate? A commentary on a doll becoming real while regular humans become robotic smart-phone zombies? If so, then they needed to emphasize that point more clearly.) What I found most enjoyable was the artistic array of a Barbie world coming to life with a cast of A-list actors and actresses of today. The cast, costumes, and art were all great portraying the dolls I grew up with. I appreciate their attempt to examine gender roles and male-female struggles with stereotypes. I just wish it had been executed better. Better dialogue. And consistency in story and tone. Like when they first get to the real world only Barbie and Ken are absurd and ridiculous which emphasizes that they don't belong there. But you go to Mattel HQ and somehow that place is just as ridiculous as the Barbie world. Hard to have a real take-away one way or another with that kind of flip-flopping.

In the real world there is a grown woman (America Ferrera) who is still into Barbies, even though her tween daughter Sasha (Arianna Greenblatt) has long stopped playing with them and regards them as hurtful to girls. (She is not wrong!) Well, the mom starts fantasising about Barbies that look like her (cellulite) and think like her (about death) and in doing so opens a portal between Barbieland and the real world. It's not as silly as it sounds and it could have worked really well exploring the questions of life and purpose and beauty and aging and all kinds of things. But instead the filmmakers decided to focus on delivering a message. As a result all the originality and creativity was sacrificed in favor of primitive ideas and an extremely black and white worldview. Men dominate the real world. All of it. But they are bumbling idiots both in the real world and in Barbieland. All of them. Women are sooo much better. All of them. Just because. It's ironic that the only Barbie who is actually capable of something is the one severely damaged by rough play.",/review/rw9319915/?ref_=tt_urv

","I am shocked at how polarizing this movie has been in terms of feedback. I say this as someone who was not anxiously anticipating its release nor as someone who was triggered by it's growing popularity, I went into this with neutrality. I knew this would have more powerful messaging than it seemed as I am a fan of Gerwigs previous works, but I knew if it did not that the film probably would leave me unfulfilled. For that reason, I was most bored during the first section of the film that was too lighthearted childlike for my taste but I was excited to get into the deeper plot points. This being said, I recognize the film was marketed ingeniously to produce buzz, however it was ineffective in describing what the movie was really about. I can totally see why parents may have thought this was appropriate for children despite the PG-13 rating but this absolutely was not made for kids. This was a campy commentary on the patriarchy in America and the modern feminist movement. These plot points were actually my biggest criticisms of it. From my perspective this displayed an accurate depiction modern feminism, which often neglects to acknowledge it's roots grown by in black feminists and the patriarchies disproportionate effects on low income women, especially those of color. This movie promoted a feminist message that feels decades behind, and in such an obvious way that I am shocked that this explored new ideas or dramatically moved anyone in the audience. It was a blunt reminder of how behind we are but not even through the messaging in the film but rather how viewers are reacting. The only feminist commentary beneath surface level that I would've been more excited to explore were made via side comments from various side characters like the socialist/anarchist daughter (who by the way I found upset to have seen painted as mean and then only kind after conforming to barbie's ideas of feminism, but I digress). With all that being said, it had a fantastic soundtrack, made me laugh quite a few times and Ryan Goslings acting was superb (ironically) although the whole cast did well with the script they were given. Justice for Michael Cera's character! I would've loved to see his cravings to break away from societal norms be further explored! The movie was fun, campy in a more obvious way than I usually like, but that's the mainstream Hollywood box office industry for you. My overall take is this wasn't made for a person like me who craves exploring new ideas or highlighting important calls to action as they relate to feminism rather than this rehashing this surface level anti-patriarchy message. I am glad that this is making people converse in what I'm understanding are new ideas to many, I am just shocked that they are in fact, new.",/review/rw9319915/?ref_=tt_urv

Robbie isn't bad but they wrote her character to be emotional and boring. In fact all of Barbies are boring in comparison to the kens. As the movie moves past barbieland it starts to struggle as the story develops. There are several scenes from this point on focusing on how Barbie (Robbie) must find out who she is essentially. These scenes drag on and kill any momentum the previous scene built. The movie rams against ""the patriarchy"" often. Ironically the funniest scenes involve the kens and how the patriarchy benefits them. Then Mattel comes into the story and that drags on. This movie should have been 20 minutes shorter and focused more on overcoming stereotypes, not condemning the patriarchy over and over.

That's the best way to sum up this overwritten, overlong, stunningly obvious treatise on gender equality, consumerism and existentialism, whose messages get beaten to death beginning early on and never let up, an exhausting experience, to be sure. Writer-director Greta Gerwig's latest offering, co-written with collaborator Noah Baumbach, features a dreadful script that's about as subtle as a young adult novel, drones on and on and on for about 30 minutes longer than it needs to be, becomes endlessly repetitive, and incorporates story threads that could have easily been scaled back or eliminated entirely (such as those with Will Ferrell and Michael Cera). What's more, much of the dialogue is either stupefyingly juvenile or sounds more like ""writing"" than anything anyone would actually say (even for a fictional fantasy character), with attempts at humor that often fall woefully flat. And, to be honest, for all intents and purposes, the project comes across like a two-hour commercial for Mattel (even if the company manages to find ways to poke fun at itself). To its credit, ""Barbie"" does have a few strengths going for it, such as its superb production design, some genuinely clever humor (especially its opening pre-titles sequence and occasional asides), and fine performances by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling (who manage to make this material look better than it actually is), as well as a heartwarming appearance by Rhea Perlman.

The only thing that shines through this story is that patriarchy is an issue, however there is not a constructive thought that can add any value to this film. The director spoons the audience with trivial concepts through the dialogues and what is depicted here is that basically the world is just filled by bad men. This is not the representation of reality. I do not deny that there are still several issues linked to abuses towards women, but this in my opinion is not the right way to address this matter. I think that with more creativity and without forcing your morals, the message would come across either way. There was a lack of respect towards the whole audience. Probably Mattel thinks that people do not have any critical thinking and they are not able to elaborate their own opinions, but they need someone that tells them how they should think and feel towards certain matters. Greta Gerwig drafts some interesting critiques towards our society that unfortunately are not properly elaborated.

Barbie is an objectively good movie when you consider it's aspects as a film.

These two things are a real standout for me, and is everything you could hope for from a Barbie movie. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling play an amazing Barbie and Ken. Something I did not expect was how much I liked Michael Cera's performance as Allan. I feel like his performance gave the film as sense of awkward relief which I enjoyed.

Serving up feminism, hyper-masculinity, misogyny and BEACHING you over the head with it was not only disappointing but was it misleading and misappropriated.
